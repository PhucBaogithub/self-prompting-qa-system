LOGO PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
============================

Please place your logo file "HoangAnh.jpg" in this static/ directory.

The system is configured to display this logo in the header next to the "Self-Prompting QA System" title.

Logo specifications:
- Filename: HoangAnh.jpg
- Recommended size: Height around 60px
- Format: JPG/JPEG
- Location: /static/HoangAnh.jpg

If you don't have the logo file yet, you can:
1. Replace the logo path in web_interface.py
2. Or simply remove the <img> tag from the header section

The system will work without the logo, but the browser may show a broken image icon until the file is provided.
